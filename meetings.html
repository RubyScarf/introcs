		</h3>
      		<p style="font-size:40px">
			Meetings will occur once a month during long lunch. The meeting should not<br>
			take up all lunch so you may have extra time to do as you wish. In the meetings<br>
			we regularly come up with fundraising ideas, food we would like to bring to share,<br>
			and talk about culture.
