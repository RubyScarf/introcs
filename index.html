			Purpose(<em>Proposito</em>)
		</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of Spanish Club is to expand the knowledge of students who <br> 
				want to learn more about the Hispanic culture. We also want to raise awareness <br>
				about the Hispanic community. We want students to be able to understand the <br>
				different races that fall under the Hispanic and Latino group. We want to be able<br>
				to teach people about the different foods we eat, some traditions we have, and even<br> 
				learn some Spanish! BUT the main purpose of Spanish Club is to have fun and eat <br>
				good food (don't tell admin that). We want to make it fun. And throughout this <br>
				we will be raising funds for an orphanage in Mexico.

			About the Meetings (<em>Sombre las Juntas<em>)
		</h3>
    			<p>
				Meetings will occur once a month during long lunch. The meeting should not<br>
				take up all lunch so you may have extra time to do as you wish. In the meetings<br>
				we regularly come up with fundraising ideas, food we would like to bring to share,<br>
				and talk about culture.
