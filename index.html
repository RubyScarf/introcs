      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of Spanish Club is to expand the knowledge of students who wwant to learn more about the Hispanic culture. We also want to raise awareness about the Hispanic community. We want students to be able to understand the different races that fall under the Hispanic and Latino group. We want to be able to teach people about the different foods we eat, some traditions we have, and even learn some Spanish! BUT the main purpose of Spanish Club is to have fun and eat good food (don't tell admin that). We want to make it fun. And throughout this we will be raising funds for an orphanage in Mexico.
