				The purpose of Spanish Club is to expand the knowledge of students who <br> 
				want to learn more about the Hispanic culture. We also want to raise awareness <br>
				about the Hispanic community. We want students to be able to understand the <br>
				different races that fall under the Hispanic and Latino group. We want to be able<br>
				to teach people about the different foods we eat, some traditions we have, and even<br> 
				learn some Spanish! BUT the main purpose of Spanish Club is to have fun and eat <br>
				good food (don't tell admin that). We want to make it fun. And throughout this <br>
				we will be raising funds for an orphanage in Mexico.
